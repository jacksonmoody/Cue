# Cue
**The Wearable Micro-Reflection System for Emotional Regulation** 

Cue is a watchOS intervention designed to support in-the-moment emotional regulation. The `/frontend` folder contains all of the iOS and watchOS code (written in Swift and SwiftUI), and the `/backend` folder contains all of the backend code (written in Express and Node.js).

This intervention was created as part of a joint thesis in Computer Science and Mind, Brain, Behavior at Harvard University. For more information, please see the experiment instructions.
